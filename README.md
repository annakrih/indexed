Verðtrygging
============

Verðtryggð Lán, or indexed linked loans, are a financial instrument widely used in Iceland
for personal and commercial loans. They are calculated using an annuity based formula
which applies the current inflation rate, as measured by the 
Consumer Price Index (CPI), to the outstanding principal of the loan, so that the principal
of the loan typically increases with inflation over time.  Interest payments calculated 
using the formula are typically less than the amount necessary to repay the increase in
principal for inflation rates above ~2.5%, causing the loans to negatively amortize.
